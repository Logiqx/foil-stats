## Foil Statistics

This project contains a collection of Python modules that have been created to analyze windsurfing foil specifications.

The goal is to produce some simple charts to illustrate the obvious similarities and differences across different brands.

All of the artefacts are available on [GitHub pages](https://logiqx.github.io/foil-stats/).
