## Slalom Windsurfing Foils

### Introduction

This little [project](https://github.com/Logiqx/foil-stats) lists the slalom foil specs for a number of windsurfing brands and provides a few simple charts.

All of the foil pages have generated from a simple JSON [configuration](https://github.com/Logiqx/foil-stats/blob/main/config/foils.json) file.

### Aspect Ratios

Aspect ratios aren't the be-all and end-all of foil design but they do influence how a foil will perform.

The aeronautical [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(aeronautics)) of aspect ratio is the wingspan divide by the the standard mean chord (SMC).

Since the SMC is also defined as the (projected) wing area divided by the wing span, aspect ratio equals the square of wing span divided by the area.

Knowing this simple formula allows the aspect ratio to be calculated from the wing area and the wing span.
